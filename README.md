# Gemdrive Giacavi IDE
## Version: 1.0a (BS 11) / (C-6)
The rules for the notation of the versions are the followings rules:

**Numeral Version:** 1.2.3
- First digit means difference with a great change for the project.
- Second digit means difference with a small or average change for the project.
- Third digit means an Important change for some reason, but not changing general tools or functions.

**Project Stage:** *1.0b*
- 'a' means that it's an **alpha** version of this project
- 'b' **beta** version
- No letter after number means that it's now a stable version.

Take in mind that the project Stage letter goes after the numeral version.

**Build Version:** (BS 11)
This build version will always go with the parenthesis and it goes after the version. Each change, eveything counts as a new build. f.e: The version was (BS 10), and if I submit an update to an source file, the build version will change (BS 10) to (BS 11).
- "BS" means: Build Submitt.
- "C" means: Compilation. Each compilation it goes 1+ for the application

## Rules
1. Don't add in any moment AI functions for this IDE.
2. The project will start using **Windows 1252**, more soon if the project had reached to an advanced level, we try to make a font for **UTF8**. Please, don't use *.ttf or .otf* fonts for the project. It's not supported by now and it will use Font Template Images. Like an image with more squares with the size for the characters. And it will be used for a different codec.
3. Conserve the Font display and the tools for the Source Files Editing on the IDE using **SDL3** and don't use other Graphics.
4. Use the English language on the first versions, and more later, you can add languages when the project goes more advanced. You can collaborate people that talks other language for help us to translate this IDE more acurrately.
5. **Gemdrive** (me) is the only authorized company for change the official name or icon.
6. For specify a version, never ad 'v' prefix. Just the version, but, there are suffixes for some cases: '-a' (f.e. *1.0a*) is for **Alpha** version, '-b' (f.e. *1.0b*) is for **Beta** version and optionally '-n' for **Nighty** versions. no suffix means it's a stable version.
