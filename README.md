# Gemdrive Giacavi IDE
## Version: 1.0a (BS 15)
The rules for the notation of the versions are the followings rules:

**Numeral Version:** 1.2.3
- First digit means difference with a great change for the project.
- Second digit means difference with a small or average change for the project.
- Third digit means a bugfix applied for the project for some reason, but not changing general tools or functions.

**Project Stage:** *1.0b*
- 'a' means that it's an **alpha** version of this project
- 'b' **beta** version
- No letter after number means that it's now a stable version.
- optionally 'n' for a nighty version.

Take in mind that the project Stage letter goes after the numeral version.

**Build Version:** (BS 11)
This build version will always go with the parenthesis and it goes after the version. Each change, eveything counts as a new build. f.e: The version was (BS 10), and if I submit an update to an source file, the build version will change (BS 10) to (BS 11)."BS" means: Build Submitt.

## Rules
1. Don't add in any moment AI functions for this IDE.
2. The project will start using **Windows 1252**, more soon we try to make a font for **UTF8** when the project had advanced.
3. Please, don't use *.ttf or .otf* fonts for the project. It's not supported by now and it will use Font Template Images. Like an image with subsquares containing characters with a different calligraphy for the personalization. Also, it's important for support personalization.
4. Conserve the Font display and the tools for the Source Files Editing on the IDE using **SDL3** and don't use other Graphics.
5. Use the English language in the first versions, and add more languages when the project becomes more advanced. Contributors who speak other languages may help with translations at that stage. **[NOT NOW]**
6. **Gemdrive** (me) is the only authorized company for change the official name or icon.
7. For specify a version, never ad 'v' prefix. Just the version, but, there are suffixes for some cases: '-a' (f.e. *1.0a*) is for **Alpha** version, '-b' (f.e. *1.0b*) is for **Beta** version and optionally '-n' for **Nighty** versions. no suffix means it's a stable version.
