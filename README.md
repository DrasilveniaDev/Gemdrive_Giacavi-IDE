# Gemdrive Giacavi IDE
## Version: 1.0a (BS 8) 
*More soon I write the version anotation rules.*

## Rules
1. Don't add in any moment AI functions for this IDE.
2. The project will start using **Windows 1252**, more soon if the project had reached to an advanced level, we try to make a font for **UTF8**. Please, don't use *.ttf or .otf* fonts for the project. It's not supported by now and it will use Font Template Images. Like an image with more squares with the size for the characters. And it will be used for a different codec.
3. Conserve the Font display and the tools for the Source Files Editing on the IDE using **SDL3** and don't use other Graphics.
4. Use the English language on the first versions, and more later, you can add languages when the project goes more advanced. You can collaborate people that talks other language for help us to translate this IDE more acurrately.
5. **Gemdrive** (me) is the only authorized company for change the official name or icon.
6. For specify a version, never ad 'v' prefix. Just the version, but, there are suffixes for some cases: '-a' (f.e. *1.0a*) is for **Alpha** version, '-b' (f.e. *1.0b*) is for **Beta** version and optionally '-n' for **Nighty** versions. no suffix means it's a stable version.
