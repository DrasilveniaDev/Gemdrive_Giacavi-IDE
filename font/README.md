# Description
this are files used for load fonts. They use raster fonts and it doesn't support *\*.otf* and *\*.ttf* font types by obvious reasons. Giacavi can support 8bit grayscale font for interpolate colors for display and decorate the IDE. It was thinked to personalizate the IDE.

do not use other image formats, only *.lct* image files. I had an issue deciding if make public my own image file extension, but after my confirmation, it will be public for now. More soon I will publish my **LCT decoder**.
